  "description": "<p>zabbix(<a href=\"http://www.zabbix.com\">http://www.zabbix.com</a>) is an enterprise-class open source free network monitoring tool that can effectively monitor the host state of Windows, Linux and Unix, network settings such as switch routers, and printers. When the status of the system or service is abnormal, an e-mail or SMS alarm is sent to the site to notify the site's operation and maintenance personnel to send a normal e-mail or SMS notification after the status is restored. Zabbix runs on a Linux/Unix platform and also provides a browser-based web interface to allow system administrators to view network status, various system issues, and services, application status, and more. The zabbix arm mainly deploys the agent, server, or monitor, and the web frontend. The client is installed on a working machine and is used for monitoring data collection.
