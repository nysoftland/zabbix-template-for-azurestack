  "description": "<b>This solution template requires you to also download Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS.</b> <p>Zabbix(<a href=\"http://www.zabbix.com\">http://www.zabbix.com</a>) is an enterprise-class open source free network monitoring tool that can effectively monitor the host state of Windows, Linux and Unix, network settings such as switch routers, and printers. When the status of the system or service is abnormal, an e-mail alarm is sent to notify the site's operation and maintenance personnel; another email will be sent after it's recovered. Zabbix runs on a Linux/Unix platform and provides a browser-based web interface to allow system administrators to view network status, various system issues, and services, application status, and more. This item mainly deploys the server, or monitor, and the web frontend. The server is generally installed on a dedicated monitoring server, and is used for data storage and processing; the web front end is used to provide users with a web page interaction interface.\n<br />\n<br />\nDeploy Zabbix monitoring solution to add functional options as follows：<br />\n1.
